# Binderz - Web App

## Midterm Group Project

#### Team Members: @arms1997 @ngoalvin @emilylim04

Binderz is a resouce wall similar to Pinterest where users (learners) are able to save learning resources like tutorials, blogs and videos in a central place that is publicly available to any user.

## Features

- Users can register, login/logout
- Users can create a new resource (add an external link, photo, title, description) and save to a specific resource category
- Users can search for already-saved resources created by any user and can search for a specific category
- Users can comment on any resource
- Users can like any resource and save to their personal liked page
- Users can rate any resource based on a 5 star system
- Users can view all of their own liked resources on their My Resources page
- Users can update their profile name

## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`

- Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB

7. Run the server: `npm run local`

- Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server

8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds.
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database.
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
